Vaagdevi Hostel has a beautifully built a campus where students are certain to feel at home. Currently, we are providing AC and non-AC rooms and a spacious dining space for all the hostel residing students. The food served for our students is of great quality, nutritious meals, and snacks. Our chefs use student surveys and feedback to create a tasty menu that is inclusive of different faith and dietary needs. The hostel facilities at Vaagdevi are subject to availability and would request students & parents to contact the admin office for further details.

Vaagdevi Hostel management has comfortable hostel facilities on campus and off-campus for both Girls and Boys.
These facilities are limited at present and hence allocated on first cum first-served basis.
Total capacity for Girls is 100 and for Boys, it is 60. Vaagdevi  Management has plans to expand its capacity in the coming years.
The Facilities have both A/C and Non-A/C with attached bath and some common bath.

<p>Mission of Vaagdevi Hostel Management<br><br>

In a hostel, life is full of opportunities of amusement and studies along. One is constantly in touch with young people of one's age and can do a lot of other activities except studying. One can make friends with one's hostel fellows who have varied tastes and aptitudes which can help you out in studying as well. One may choose his friends according to his own likes and interests and can spend quality time with buddies even after the classes. Mutual discussions of their favourite film actors and actresses, long criticism of the latest picture seen by them, and story-telling, add charm to hostel life. Good arrangements of games and sports, Sunday specials and eating competitions, and day-to-day merry-making make the hostel life a thing of envy for all. Apart from fun-leisure activities, hostellers have a unique unity and are always ready to help one another wheneverÂ needed.
